# YOLO
Simple YOLO project

to start
run anaconda terminal

Write 
1. cd my_model path

2. conda activate datasetimages

3. python yolo_gui.py 

The second should open the app

File can be closed via x and via ctrl + c on terminal
 
 When I pused the changes onto git it wouldn't oppen the my_module.py in git, so just in case i put in a zip.

 BONUS
 Here is my google collab notebook

The data.zip are the images i used for training
